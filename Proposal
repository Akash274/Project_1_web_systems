Using Facebook Photos API and Google App Engine to create a Social Media Application

Using Facebook Photos API and Google Cloud Storage and Computer Vision API's for object detection.

Introduction:
We will retrieve a Facebook photo from the user’s Facebook profile using Graph API and we will further use the retrieved photo for processing 
results through Google SaaS Computer Vision API for the desired result then we will use Google Analytics Platform (App Engine Server Side Analytics) 
as it provides computing resources to collect, store, process, and report on these user-interactions.

Proposal:
The application will be able to access the photos of users on his/her Facebook profile using the Facebook Graph API and will store the photo in Google DataStrore.
The cloud vision will be used to detect the objects in the photos and will return appropriate labels with respect to the image. Image object detection will be 
used to classify the image and use this information for further analytics.

Implementation:
We will use Google Saas’s cloud API for image analytics and further use the analytics to classify image according to the usage and preference of the user, 
the meta data of the images will be stored in the application to further perform and functions or build over the application itself.
